# Spring-Annotations Project 

_This project is an application developed using the Spring Framework, a Java-based application development framework. It leverages the annotations and features provided by Spring to configure the application and manage dependencies._


## Project Description

_The Spring-Annotations project utilizes the powerful features of the Spring Framework to handle the configuration of an application. It embraces the principles of Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) provided by Spring._

_The project showcases the usage of Spring annotations and configuration classes to wire together different components of the application. By following the Spring best practices, it achieves loose coupling and modular design, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the application._


## Features

- Utilizes Spring annotations for component scanning and dependency injection.
- Configures the application properties using the @PropertySource annotation.
- Demonstrates the usage of @Bean annotations to define beans and manage dependencies.
- Showcases the usage of Spring's Environment object to access application properties.
- Leverages the power of Spring's component scanning to automatically discover and wire components.
